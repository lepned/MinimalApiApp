# MinimalApiApp

Minimal APIs are now the default in .NET 6. In this application we set up a simple but full CRUD data layer for communication with a SQL Server database.
Then we build up a minimal API, and a Blazor Server layer on top of that. Other than Blazor Client Side (WebAssembly), this approach will work with
any user interface. 

The original inspiration comes from a Tim Corey course on YouTube called: Data Access with Dapper and SQL.
