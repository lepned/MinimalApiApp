# MinimalApiApp

Minimal APIs are now the default in .NET 6. In this application we set up a simple but full CRUD data layer.
Then we concentrate on building up a minimal API on top of that. This approach will work with almost any user interface,
not just a minimal API. Finally, we add a Blazor Server layer serving as the GUI.
